local_action will always take place on the system that you are running the playbook from, delegateto will take
place on any host that you indicate.


When you would use them depends on what you are doing, but you could be copying a backup image from your local machine
 to a remote system (local_action using the copy module for example) and then running a test against that using a 
utility installed on another system (delegateto your logging server for example).
