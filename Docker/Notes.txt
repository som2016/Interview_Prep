image is a static file thru which we run containers

We use docker due to its containerization feature which is light weight and can run many such container open close whenever we want with
ease. virtualization done to os not to h/w.


Registry: is a service to store images like docker hub(which is a public registry). companies can have their own registry. A registry will have repository and 
repo will have images.

docker.io/myrepo/tagname> docker.io=registry, myrepo=repo under docker.io registry, tagname=imagename, if we dont give tag name it will
auto pick up "latest" as its name.

tags will show the images in docker hub portal.

need to know bind mounts

all container ip will be under same network so that they can share

Dockerfile > used for creating custom image

Docker-compose > used for spinning up multiple docker at once with each connected with other. like a app server a dbserver containers etc.

Docker Swarm: Its a technique/tool to manage multiple containers running in cluster of docker hosts
